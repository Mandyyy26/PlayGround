Proof Of Stake: 

-> Its a consensus mechanism that allows the network to reach agreement on the state of the blockchain.
-> It is a more energy efficient alternative to Proof Of Work.
-> In PoS, the validators are the ones who have the most stake in the network.
-> The more stake you have, the more likely you are to be a validator.

To become a validator, one must stake atleast 32 ETH to the deposit contract.
and must run the software on its system. 

-> software consists of three components:
* validator client
* execution client
* consensus client

-> validator client is responsible for signing and attesting the blocks and proposing new ones.
-> execution client is responsible for executing the transactions and storing the state.
-> consensus client is responsible for coordinating the validators and proposing the new state.

How Transactions are processed:

1. User creates and sign a transaction and send it to the ethereum network. 
-> this is usually done using a wallet, web3.js, ether.js, etc.  Under the hood user is sending a JSON RPC request to the node.

2. Transaction is validated by the network and then broadcasted to all the nodes in the network.
-> in this the normal checks are performed such as user has enough balance, transaction is valid, etc.

3. Once the transaction is validated  by the network, it is added to the mempool.
-> mempool is a pool of transactions that are waiting to be included in the block.

4. the node that will create the next block is selected randomly with the help of RANDAO. 
-> RANDAO is a random number generator that is used to select the node that will create the next block.

5. The selected node will take the transaction from the mempool and execute it by its execution client.
-> the execution client will execute the transaction and store the state.

6. then it send the block to the consensus client, which will broadcast it to all the other nodes in the network.

7. Once the block is broadcasted to the network, the other nodes will validate the block.
-> they will check if the block is valid, if it is, they will add it to their blockchain.

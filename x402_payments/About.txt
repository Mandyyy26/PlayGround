What it is:

it is an Open payment system that enables any website, app or serviec to request and collect payment before delivering content or services.
In this the payement is directly accessible through http requests.

Problems it solves:

micropayment barriers
Ai agent autonomy bottlenecks
and so many others


How it works:

Step 1: Request -> Quote
the client requests a resource ------ the server replies with http 402 payment required(with JSON payload that contains:
Price, SUpported netwrok and Facilitotor endpoint for verification).

at this point, the client knows exactly what to pay and where.


Step 2: Pay -> Verify
the client generates a signed payment payload and retries the request with the same payload, adding an X-PAYMENT header.
Then the server forwards this payload to the facilitators ednpoint.
the facilitator then verifies the signature and confirms that the patment parameters are valid.

Step 3: Settle -> deliver

-> Eigen layer provides economic security as a service.

* for developer: It allows them to rent the massive security of ethereum existing validator set.

* For Stakers: It provides a way to earn extra yield on already staked ETH on Ethereum.

The problem it is solving is:
-> Bootstrapping problem
-> security fragmentation
-> Capital Inefficiency

EXAMPLE: 
Lets say we are building a new ROllup that needs to store massive data securely.
WIthout EigneLaye => we would have to build a new netwrok of node to store that data securely.
With EigenLayer => we could use EigenDA(a data availability service) secure by Ethereum's
